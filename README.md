# OSTemplate
An operating system that currently doesn't do much<br>
If you are are devving an OS, feel free to take some of my code. The hard bit about osdev is not writing the code, but getting it to work with your other code. I can't help with that, but integrating working code is much easier than integrating broken code.

Many thanks to http://wiki.osdev.org. Without them, I would never have even started upon this project
